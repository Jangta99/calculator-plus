Steps
1. Download the .zip file
2. Install React js in the ./React JS Calculator/calculator path
3. To run the file, go to the ./React JS Calculator/calculator path.
4. Then type in "npm start" to run the program.
The program should work afterwards!

Based off the original code here:
https://github.com/angle943/iphone-calculator

Changed several things from the original above. Among the changes:
1. Made the program work with decimal points
2. Added hover colors over the buttons
3. Made the program work with using double operators. For example, 5 + 5 + (using plus instead of equals) will still result in 10.
4. Made the program faster and more efficient by replace multiple if-else statements with switch statements.
